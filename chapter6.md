# Chapter 6: The Five Nines Concept
## 6.1 High Availability

The systems and services are available 99.999% of the time. This is les then 5.26 minutes a year.
Om dit te bekomen:

- eliminate the `single points of failure`
- design for reliability
- detect failures as they occur

Rnvironments that need Five Nines: Finance industry, health care facilities, public safety, retail industry and the media industry. 

**Threats to Availability:**

- `Natural Disasters`
- `Human Error`:  data entry error / drops laptop computer
- `Hardware Failure`
- `Sabotage`: attackers installs backdoor or worm that erases files
- `software attacks`
- `Software errors`: bugs
- `theft`: equipment stolen
- `Utility Interruption`: Electrical power failure / ISP fail



**Three principles:**

- `Single point of failure`: point in critical operation that causes the entire operation to fail should it fail 
- `System Resiliency`: Ability to maintain availability during disruptive events.
- `fault Tolerance`: enables a system to continue operating if one or more components fail
