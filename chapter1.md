### 1.1.1 Cybersecurity domains
There are loads of "groups" collecting mass amounts of data. Think about Google, Facebook, ... Each of these can be seen as a domain. This domain needs to be protected.

Amateurs: At home, with no skill trying to hack systems.  
Hackers: This group of criminals breaks into computers or networks to gain access for various reasons.  
Organised Hackers: These criminals include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers. Cyber criminals are usually groups of professional criminals focused on control, power, and wealth. The criminals are highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service.  
White hat hackers: These are ethical hackers. They have the permission to test the security of a system by trying to hack it. When they found a vulnerability, they repost these to the developers to fix it.  
Grey hat hackers: They commit crimes without permission but not to cause damage. Afterwards they may disclose the vulnerability publicly and the affected organisation fixes the problem.  
Black hat hackers: They hack systems for their own benefit and malicious reasons.

#### 1.2.2.2 Thwarting Cyber Criminals
Vulnerability database: Collection of known vulnerabilities  
Early warning systems: Establishing early warning sensors and alert networks. Due to cost and the impossibility of monitoring every network, organizations monitor high-value targets or create imposters that look like high-value targets. Because these high-value targets are more likely to experience attacks, they warn others of potential attacks.  
Share Cyber Intelligence: Sharing cyber intelligence information. Business, government agencies and countries now collaborate to share critical information about serious attacks to critical targets in order to prevent similar attacks in other places. Many countries have established cyber intelligence agencies to collaborate worldwide in combating major cyberattacks.  
ISM Standards: Establishing information security management standards among national and international organizations. The ISO 27000 is a good example of these international efforts.  
New Laws: Enacting new laws to discourage cyberattacks and data breaches. These laws have severe penalties to punish cyber criminals caught carrying out illegal actions.
